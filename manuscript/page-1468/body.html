<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>“Marie, I was dropping asleep.… Ah, what a wretch I am, Marie!”</p><p>She sat up, looking about her with wonder, seeming not to recognise where she was, and suddenly leapt up in indignation and anger.</p><p>“I’ve taken your bed, I fell asleep so tired I didn’t know what I was doing; how dared you not wake me? How could you dare imagine I meant to be a burden to you?”</p><p>“How could I wake you, Marie?”</p><p>“You could, you ought to have! You’ve no other bed here, and I’ve taken yours. You had no business to put me into a false position. Or do you suppose that I’ve come to take advantage of your charity? Kindly get into your bed at once and I’ll lie down in the corner on some chairs.”</p><p>“Marie, there aren’t chairs enough, and there’s nothing to put on them.”</p></div> </div>
