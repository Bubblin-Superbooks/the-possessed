Do you know, Shatushka, I’ve had a dream: he came to me again, he beckoned me, called me. ‘My little puss,’ he cried to me, ‘little puss, come to me!’ And I was more delighted at that ‘little puss’ than anything; he loves me, I thought.”</p><p>“Perhaps he will come in reality,” Shatov muttered in an undertone.</p><p>“No, Shatushka, that’s a dream.… He can’t come in reality.

   This tiny cell’s enough for me;
   There will I dwell my soul to save
   And ever pray to God for thee.’</p></blockquote><p>Ach, Shatushka, Shatushka, my dear, why do you never ask me about anything?”</p><p>“Why, you won’t tell. That’s why I don’t ask.”</p></div> </div>
