The old woman is in the hospital, her daughter-in-law is dead. I’ve been alone for the last two days. I’ve shown him the place in the paling where you can take a board out; he gets through, no one sees.”</p><p>“I’ll take him away soon.”</p><p>“He says he has got plenty of places to stay the night in.”</p><p>“That’s rot; they are looking for him, but here he wouldn’t be noticed. Do you ever get into talk with him?”</p><p>“Yes, at night. He abuses you tremendously. I’ve been reading the ‘Apocalypse’ to him at night, and we have tea. He listened eagerly, very eagerly, the whole night.”</p></div> </div>
