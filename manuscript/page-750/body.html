Her eyes were tranquil, though her face was pale.</p><p>“Where have you come from?” exclaimed Stavrogin.</p><p>“I was standing there, and waiting for him to go out, to come in to you. I heard the order you gave him, and when he came out just now I hid round the corner, on the right, and he didn’t notice me.”</p><p>“I’ve long meant to break off with you, Dasha … for a while … for the present. I couldn’t see you last night, in spite of your note. I meant to write to you myself, but I don’t know how to write,” he added with vexation, almost as though with disgust.</p><p>“I thought myself that we must break it off. Varvara Petrovna is too suspicious of our relations.”</p><p>“Well, let her be.”</p><p>“She mustn’t be worried. So now we part till the end comes.”</p><p>“You still insist on expecting the end?”</p></div> </div>
