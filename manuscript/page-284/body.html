<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">love you.… Ach, heavens! He has my portrait on the wall! Give it here. I remember it! I remember it!”</p><p>An exquisite miniature in water-colour of Liza at twelve years old had been sent nine years before to Stepan Trofimovitch from Petersburg by the Drozdovs. He had kept it hanging on his wall ever since.</p><p>“Was I such a pretty child? Can that really have been my face?”</p><p>She stood up, and with the portrait in her hand looked in the looking-glass.</p><p>“Make haste, take it!” she cried, giving back the portrait. “Don’t hang it up now, afterwards. I don’t want to look at it.”</p><p>She sat down on the sofa again. “One life is over and another is begun, then that one is over—a third begins, and so on, endlessly. All the ends are snipped off as it were with scissors. See what stale things I’m telling you. Yet how much truth there is in them!”</p></div> </div>
