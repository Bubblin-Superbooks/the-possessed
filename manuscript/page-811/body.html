It’s all according to the views of the government. If the mood takes them so that institutions seem suddenly necessary, I shall have them at once in readiness. The necessity passes and no one will find them under my rule. That’s what I understand by <em>activité dévorante</em>, and you can’t have it without an increase of the governor’s power. We’re talking <em>tête-à-tête</em>. You know I’ve already laid before the government in Petersburg the necessity of a special sentinel before the governor’s house. I’m awaiting an answer.”</p></div> </div>
