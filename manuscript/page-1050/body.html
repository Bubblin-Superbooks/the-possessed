<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>“What question? What question?” every one clamoured.</p><p>“A question that will make it clear whether we are to remain together, or take up our hats and go our several ways without speaking.”</p><p>“The question! The question!”</p><p>“If any one of us knew of a proposed political murder, would he, in view of all the consequences, go to give information, or would he stay at home and await events? Opinions may differ on this point. The answer to the question will tell us clearly whether we are to separate, or to remain together and for far longer than this one evening. Let me appeal to you first.” He turned to the lame man.</p><p>“Why to me first?”</p><p>“Because you began it all. Be so good as not to prevaricate; it won’t help you to be cunning. But please yourself, it’s for you to decide.”</p></div> </div>
