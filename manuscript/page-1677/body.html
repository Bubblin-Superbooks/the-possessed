What do you think of her? Her heart is pure.…”</p><p>And to the amazement and perhaps still greater alarm of Sofya Matveyevna, she suddenly patted her on the cheek.</p><p>“It’s only a pity she is a fool. Too great a fool for her age. That’s all right, my dear, I’ll look after you. I see that it’s all nonsense. Stay near here for the time. A room shall be taken for you and you shall have food and everything else from me … till I ask for you.”</p><p>Sofya Matveyevna stammered in alarm that she must hurry on.</p><p>“You’ve no need to hurry. I’ll buy all your books, and meantime you stay here. Hold your tongue; don’t make excuses. If I hadn’t come you would have stayed with him all the same, wouldn’t you?”</p></div> </div>
