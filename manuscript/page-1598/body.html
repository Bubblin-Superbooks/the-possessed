Berestov, the colonel, an awfully funny fellow, is travelling with me in the first class. He is a neighbour of ours in the country, and his wife is a Garin (<em>née</em> de Garine), and you know he is a very decent fellow. He’s got ideas too. He’s only been here a couple of days.

I’ve already fixed on a fourth—Pripuhlov, our merchant from T——with a beard, a millionaire—I mean it, a real millionaire; you can take my word for it.… I’ll introduce you; he is a very interesting money-bag. We shall have a laugh.”</p><p>“I shall be delighted, and I am awfully fond of cards in the train, but I am going second class.”</p></div> </div>
