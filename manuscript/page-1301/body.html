<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">panic-stricken. I remember one hysterical, tearful feminine shriek:</p><p>“Ach, the same thing again!”</p><p>And in the retreat of the guests, which was almost becoming a crush, another bomb exploded exactly as in the afternoon.</p><p>“Fire! All the riverside quarter is on fire!”</p><p>I don’t remember where this terrible cry rose first, whether it was first raised in the hall, or whether someone ran upstairs from the entry, but it was followed by such alarm that I can’t attempt to describe it. More than half the guests at the ball came from the quarter beyond the river, and were owners or occupiers of wooden houses in that district. They rushed to the windows, pulled back the curtains in a flash, and tore down the blinds. The riverside was in flames. The fire, it is true, was only beginning, but it was in flames in three separate places—and that was what was alarming.</p></div> </div>
