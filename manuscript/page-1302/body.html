<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>“Arson! The Shpigulin men!” roared the crowd.</p><p>I remember some very characteristic exclamations:</p><p>“I’ve had a presentiment in my heart that there’d be arson, I’ve had a presentiment of it these last few days!”</p><p>“The Shpigulin men, the Shpigulin men, no one else!”</p><p>“We were all lured here on purpose to set fire to it!”</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">This last most amazing exclamation came from a woman; it was an unintentional involuntary shriek of a housewife whose goods were burning. Every one rushed for the door. I won’t describe the crush in the vestibule over sorting out cloaks, shawls, and pelisses, the shrieks of the frightened women, the weeping of the young ladies. I doubt whether there was any theft, but it was no wonder that in such disorder some went away without their wraps because they were unable to find them, and this grew into a legend with many additions, long preserved in the town.
