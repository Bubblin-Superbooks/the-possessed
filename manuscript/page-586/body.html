Oh no … only fancy … I thought you were looking for your stick.”</p><p>Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was looking for nothing and said nothing.</p><p>But he had risen to his feet very suddenly with a strange look in his face.</p><p>“If you want any help about Mr. Gaganov either,” Pyotr Stepanovitch blurted out suddenly, this time looking straight at the paper-weight, “of course I can arrange it all, and I’m certain you won’t be able to manage without me.”</p><p>He went out suddenly without waiting for an answer, but thrust his head in at the door once more. “I mention that,” he gabbled hurriedly, “because Shatov had no right either, you know, to risk his life last Sunday when he attacked you, had he? I should be glad if you would make a note of that.” He disappeared again without waiting for an answer.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
