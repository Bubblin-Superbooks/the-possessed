<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">fancy, as I flew here in a racing droshky I saw Mavriky Nikolaevitch by the fence at the farthest corner of your garden … in his greatcoat, drenched through, he must have been sitting there all night! Queer goings on! How mad people can be!”</p><p>“Mavriky Nikolaevitch? Is that true?”</p><p>“Yes, yes. He is sitting by the garden fence. About three hundred paces from here, I think. I made haste to pass him, but he saw me. Didn’t you know? In that case I am glad I didn’t forget to tell you. A man like that is more dangerous than anyone if he happens to have a revolver about him, and then the night, the sleet, or natural irritability—for after all he is in a nice position, ha ha! What do you think? Why is he sitting there?”</p><p>“He is waiting for Lizaveta Nikolaevna, of course.”</p><p>“Well! Why should she go out to him? And … in such rain too … what a fool!”</p><p>“She is just going out to him!”</p></div> </div>
