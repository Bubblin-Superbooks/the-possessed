Verhovensky turned to the general company with a capitally simulated look of alarm.</p><p>“Gentlemen, I deem it my duty to declare that all this is folly, and that our conversation has gone too far. I have so far initiated no one, and no one has the right to say of me that I initiate members. We were simply discussing our opinions. That’s so, isn’t it? But whether that’s so or not, you alarm me very much.” He turned to the lame man again. “I had no idea that it was unsafe here to speak of such practically innocent matters except <em>tête-à-tête</em>. Are you afraid of informers? Can there possibly be an informer among us here?”</p><p>The excitement became tremendous; all began talking.</p><p>“Gentlemen, if that is so,” Verhovensky went on, “I have compromised myself more than anyone, and so I will ask you to answer one question, if you care to, of course. You are all perfectly free.”</p></div> </div>
