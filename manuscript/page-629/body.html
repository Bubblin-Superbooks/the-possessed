Is that so?”</p><p>“Yes … she used to listen …” said Shatov, confused.</p><p>“Within a day or two I intend to make a public announcement of our marriage here in the town.”</p><p>“Is that possible?” Shatov whispered, almost with horror.</p><p>“I don’t quite understand you. There’s no sort of difficulty about it, witnesses to the marriage are here. Everything took place in Petersburg, perfectly legally and smoothly, and if it has not been made known till now, it is simply because the witnesses, Kirillov, Pyotr Verhovensky, and Lebyadkin (whom I now have the pleasure of claiming as a brother-in-law) promised to hold their tongues.”</p></div> </div>
